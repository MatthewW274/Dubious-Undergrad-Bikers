## Mission Statement 
Cycling infrastructure has become a major transportation policy issue in Ontario, with recently proposed changes affecting whether and where protected bike lanes can be built or maintained (Ecojustice, 2025). In 2025, the Ontario government moved to create policy that would require provincial approval for bike lanes and aimed to remove protected bike lanes on Bloor St., University Ave., and Yonge St. through the Highway Traffic Act amendments in the *Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act* (Ecojustice, 2025). Additionally, in November 2025, the government acted to pass Bill 56, the *Building a More Competitive Economy Act*, removing speed cameras across the province (Legislative Assembly of Ontario, 2025). While similar policy debates have occurred across North America, decisions at this scale affect cycling safety and long-term bike network planning across Ontario. 

That's why we made Bike2Basics. We want our app to advocate for active transportation as a priority, rather than an afterthought in the City of Toronto. We believe in cycling as a low-cost, accessible, and sustainable alternative to driving as it significantly lowers emissions and pollution that would otherwise be generated by automobile trips (Monazzam et al., 2021). Furthermore, cycling has many mental and physical health benefits for those who choose to commute by bicycle, including connection with nature and improved fitness (Oja et al., 2011; Garrard et al., 2012). Cycling also encourages more connection within the community as cycling groups offer an accessible way for people to make new friends and see new areas of their city (Garrard et al., 2012). With these benefits of cycling in mind, we decided to make an app for policymakers to easily assess the best locations to improve or create new, safe, and accessible bike infrastructure.

Our mission is to give Toronto planners a clear, evidence based tool to prioritize cycling investments. Our app achieves this by allowing for adjustable weighting of bike safety metrics and bike accessibility metrics to produce a combined multi-criteria analysis that shows where upgrades in biking infrastructure will matter most. Protected infrastructure in Toronto has been linked to safer streets. After cycle tracks were installed, there was a "38% reduction in cyclist-motor-vehicle collision rates after accounting for ridership" (Ling et al., 2020). Other data has proven that "Canadians who support climate action are more likely to back low carbon transport than compact city policies" (Wynes & Matthews, 2023). Together, these results support a simple fact: turning Toronto cycling data into visible priorities for safer and more connected infrastructure can help decision-makers invest where the need is greatest, justify projects with evidence, and build a biking network that makes people feel safer every day. 

## App Characteristics 
### What the app does
The app allows user to use the Point Allocation Method to assign weights to each criteria (factor) in how significantly they affect the individual indices' scores, followed by weighting how significantly each index contributes to overall usability. The point allocation method was utilizied so that all weights of each factor add up to 100%. Users can change both the weights of the individual factors within each overall index (safety and accessibility) and the weights of each overall index (safety, accessibility, and speed). Users can also switch between tabs that show the accessibility, safety, and combined indices to see how these indices change when weights are changed.

### Why it's useful and unique 

Bike2Basics is useful because it combines several cycling datasets into one map that users can adjust. Instead of one fixed “safety” score, users can change the weights for factors like LTS, collisions, theft, lighting, and access to bikeshare/parking. This lets planners test different priorities (like night riding vs. daytime, or safety vs. speed) and quickly see where Toronto’s biking network is strong or needs improvement.

### Key decisions it supports 

The app supports real planning and policy decisions, including: where to build new protected infrastructure for high priority areas, which neighborhoods are underserved by key components of cycling comfort (lighting, bikeshare, parking, etc.), what type of intervention is most needed in a location (for example, safety upgrades vs. access improvements), how priorities change under different goals (safety vs. speed/travel time), and how to justify investments with evidence by linking proposed upgrades to measurable factors.

## App Overview and User Guide 
### Study Area 
Our study area is limited to the City of Toronto's city limits. This area has a diverse array of biking infrastructure that will help us analyze the ease and comfort of biking throughout the city.
### Common Controls - Tab Navigation Between Indices, Weight Adjustments
To use the Bike2Basics app, click on one of the indices below this tab. Each tab has a number of factors related to bicycle comfort. The safety index has a streetlight density index, a bike theft index, a bike collisions index, and a level of traffic stress index. The accessibility index has a level of traffic stress index, a bike parking index, and a bikeshare index. The combined index has the previously calculated safety and accessibility indices, with an added speed index. All weights are adjustable using the sliders or the text boxes on the side of the app. Feel free to adjust the factors and take a look at how various indices impact the cycling experience in the city of Toronto.
### Three Tabs 
- Tab 1: Safety Index
- Tab 2: Accessibility Index
- Tab 3: Combined Index (including speed)
### How to interpret the scores (high vs low)

In any layer, the higher the score, the harder it is to be comfortable biking in that area. This can be caused by factors including but not limited to unsafe bike infrastructure, high bike theft, and a high density of bike collisions with cars.

## Results and Key Takeaways 
### Patterns 
According to our default cycling index, which is shown when first opening the app, much of the City of Toronto has middling cycling comfort. This is unsurprising as much of the city, especially outside of the downtown, is composed of suburban streets that may have slow moving vehicles and safer streets, but do not necessarily have access to bikeshare stations and bike parking.  Also unsurprisingly, major arterial roads without bike lanes, like Lakeshore Avenue near Humber Bay, are ranked as the worst for cycling comfort. Trail networks across the city, like those in the Don and Humber River valleys, rank very well on our index. This shows that dedicated cycling infrastructure that is safe, well-lit, near parking and bikeshare stations, and separated from cars is always the best option for the cycling experience. Interestingly, many pockets of downtown are very bike-friendly according to our index. While theft and cycling accidents are more likely in the downtown core, established safe bike infrastructure, access to bicycle parking, and access to bikeshare stations help increase the scores in downtown Toronto.
### Notable area 
One notably surprising result of our index was the relatively middling score of the Toronto Islands. While these islands do not have cars (other than emergency vehicles), they do have a lack of bikeshare stations, some pockets of high theft, and a lack of lighting infrastructure. Overall, this leads to a lower score than otherwise expected for this area. This is one of the reasons why we allow for variable weights of each index in our app. If people are biking during the day, theft is less likely and streetlights are a relatively negligible factor, so those weights can be lessened to yield a more accurate analysis.

## Limitations
### Data limitations
During our analysis, a number of limitations were present throughout our various datasets. Firstly, it was thought as potentially more advantageous to measure accessibility of cycling utilizing distance to bike racks and bike share stations rather than density. However, the distance accumulation tool refused to cover the entire study area during our analysis, so in the interest of proper raster math expressions, we opted to utilize the kernel density tool for these parameters instead. The utilization of the kernel density tool includes multiple limitations as well, chiefly pertaining to the selected cell size and bandwidth. A cell size of 25 square metres was chosen for this analysis in order to initially preserve block to block variation in our data throughout our study area. A bandwidth of 300 metres was chosen as it was the width of approximately 3 city blocks. Obviously, our analysis may change if these quantities changed, but we believe that these two choices were the best for our analysis. Another limitation of this analysis is data loss during reclassification of rasters. This was a necessary step in order to come up with a final cycling comfort index, but it should be acknowledged that anytime rasters are reclassified, variation in the data is lost. Furthermore, some data variation is lost in the Add Surface Information step of our tool. This is because the statistic it calculates is the average value of raster cells that underlay each road/trail section. However, the City of Toronto's centrelines dataset has very short road/trail sections, so this loss is insignificant. While a Raster to Polyline tool could have been used to preserve variation, it was decided that a more aesthetically appealing layer was valued over this information loss. Thus, the Add Surface Information tool was utilized. Importantly, a few road centreline segments were missing in the City of Toronto's dataset, limiting some of the routing options. Lastly, in our travel time analysis, one limitation is elevation. Every cyclist will react differently to hills, so we opted not to have slope information as an impedance to speed. However, if a cyclist is commuting on the same route twice a day, the speed will average out to near our value.
### Assumptions 
For the LTS (Level of Traffic Stress) analysis, 5 classes were outlined. Typically, 4 would be utilized as outlined in Raj's cited ECCE blog post, but due to the variation of bike infrastructure and road types throughout Toronto, we felt that 5 classes would be more appropriate (Ubhi, 2021). Note that routes like the 401, 407, or any other major freeway were excluded from the road/bike safety analysis. This is because they are illegal to bike on.

Additionally, the average biking speed was assumed to be 15 km/h and the average wait time at each traffic light was assumed to be 18 seconds (BicyclesandCycling, n.d.; INRIX, 2022). 
### Time of day / seasonality 
Our method of analysis is limited by the time of day. Perceived safety is variable depending on a number of factors, including light levels (Boyce et. al, 2000). Our analysis includes streetlights as a factor, but the weighted cycling index calculated in our script cannot adjust this factor to 0 during the day. This is part of the reason why users of the app can adjust weights of each factor in our app. If someone only rides during daylight, that factor can be set to a weight of 0. Additionally, our method does not include any information on when snow is cleared on certain routes, which would impact the accessibility of biking to certain neighbourhoods during Canadian winters (Sears et. al, 2012.
### Next steps for future study 
Another analysis outside the scope of our project that could be undertaken is a biking justice analysis. Based on many socioeconomic factors from the Canadian census, this would show which neighbourhoods throughout the City of Toronto have access to safe and accessible biking and which neighbourhoods do not. Our team hopes that everyone in the City of Toronto has safe and equitable access to active transportation. However, this analysis was outside of our abilities given the tight timelines of the app challenge.
