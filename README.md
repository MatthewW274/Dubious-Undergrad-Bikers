**Matthew Woodward:** 
I am a fourth-year student at the University of Waterloo majoring in Geography and Environmental Management and minoring in Earth Sciences. I was a gold medalist at the International Geography Olympiad, placing eighteenth worldwide in 2022. I am also a recent inductee into the Royal Canadian Geographical Society’s College of Fellows. My areas of interest include geographic education, GIS applications in species conservation, statistical analysis of meteorological flux data, and GIS applications in tracking and documenting meteorological hazards. You can find more of my geographic education work on the True North Geography YouTube channel, which aims to increase the accessibility of geographic education to Canadians by bringing in-field examples of geographic processes to a free platform.
  
**Julianne Ho**
I am a third-year undergraduate student at UW in the Geography and Environmental Management program specializing in Geomatics and minoring in Urban Studies, though I was first brought into spatial sciences because of a love for ecology. I have always been interested in how organisms move and interact with their environment, and that extends to people! My most recent interests in applying GIS are in reducing bird collisions on campus, contributing to federal Species at Risk recovery and conservation, and studying severe weather impacts on people and ecosystems. In my free time, I like to dillydally with birding, geocaching and kendo.

## Mission Statement 
Cycling infrastructure has become a major transportation policy issue in Ontario, with recently proposed changes affecting whether and where protected bike lanes can be built or maintained (Ecojustice, 2025). In 2025, the Ford government moved to create policy that would require provincial approval for bike lanes and aimed to remove protected bike lanes on Bloor St., University Ave., and Yonge St. through the Highway Traffic Act amendments in the *Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act* (Ecojustice, 2025). Additionally, in November 2025, the government acted to pass Bill 56, the *Building a More Competitive Economy Act*, removing speed cameras across the province (Legislative Assembly of Ontario, 2025). While similar policy debates have occurred across North America, decisions at this scale affect cycling safety and long-term bike network planning across Ontario. 

That's why we made [insert app name here]. We want our app to advocate for active transportation as a priority, rather than an afterthought in the City of Toronto. We believe in cycling as a low-cost, accessible, and sustainable alternative to driving as it significantly lowers emissions and pollution that would otherwise be generated by automobile trips (Monazzam et al., 2021). Furthermore, cycling has many mental and physical health benefits for those who choose to commute by bicycle, including connection with nature and improved fitness (Oja et al., 2011; Garrard et al., 2012). Cycling also encourages more connection within the community as cycling groups offer an accessible way for people to make new friends and see new areas of their city (Garrard et al., 2012). With these benefits of cycling in mind, we decided to make an app for policymakers to easily assess the best locations to improve or create new, safe, and accessible bike infrastructure.

Our mission is to give Toronto planners a clear, evidence-based tool to prioritize cycling investments. Our app achieves this by allowing for adjustable weighting of bike safety metrics and bike accessibility metrics to produce a combined multi-criteria analysis that shows where upgrades in biking infrastructure will matter most. Protected infrastructure in Toronto has been linked to safer streets. After cycle tracks were installed, there was a "38% reduction in cyclist-motor-vehicle collision rates after accounting for ridership" (Ling et al., 2020). Other data has proven that "Canadians who support climate action are more likely to back low carbon transport than compact city policies" (Wynes & Matthews, 2023). Together, these results support a simple fact: turning Toronto cycling data into visible priorities for safer and more connected infrastructure can help decision-makers invest where the need is greatest, justify projects with evidence, and build a biking network that makes people feel safer every day.

## App Overview 
### Study Area 
Our study area is limited to the City of Toronto's city limits. This area has a diverse array of biking infrastructure that will help us analyze the ease and comfort of biking throughout the city.
### Three Tabs 
- Tab 1: Safety Index
- Tab 2: Accessibility Index
- Tab 3: Combined Index

### How to interpret the scores (high vs low)

In any layer, the higher the score, the harder it is to be comfortable biking in that area. This can be caused by factors including but not limited to unsafe bike infrastructure, high bike theft, and a high density of bike collisions with cars.

## Limitations
### Data limitations
During our analysis, a number of limitations were present throughout our various datasets. Firstly, it was thought as potentially more advantageous to measure accessibility of cycling utilizing distance to bike racks and bike share stations rather than density. However, the distance accumulation tool refused to cover the entire study area during our analysis, so in the interest of proper raster math expressions, we opted to utilize the kernel density tool for these parameters instead. The utilization of the kernel density tool includes multiple limitations as well, chiefly pertaining to the selected cell size and bandwidth. A cell size of 25 square metres was chosen for this analysis in order to initially preserve block to block variation in our data throughout our study area. A bandwidth of 300 metres was chosen as it was the width of approximately 3 city blocks. Obviously, our analysis may change if these quantities changed, but we believe that these two choices were the best for our analysis. Another limitation of this analysis is data loss during reclassification of rasters. This was a necessary step in order to come up with a final cycling comfort index, but it should be acknowledged that anytime rasters are reclassified, variation in the data is lost. Furthermore, some data variation is lost in the Add Surface Information step of our tool. This is because the statistic it calculates is the average value of raster cells that underlay each road/trail section. However, the City of Toronto's centrelines dataset has very short road/trail sections, so this loss is insignificant. While a Raster to Polyline tool could have been used to preserve variation, it was decided that a more aesthetically appealing layer was valued over this information loss. Thus, the Add Surface Information tool was utilized. 
### Assumptions 
For the LTS (Level of Traffic Stress) analysis, 5 classes were outlined. Typically, 4 would be utilized as outlined in Raj's cited ECCE blog post, but due to the variation of bike infrastructure and road types throughout Toronto, we felt that 5 classes would be more appropriate (Ubhi, 2021). Note that routes like the 401, 407, or any other major freeway were excluded from the road/bike safety analysis. This is because they are illegal to bike on.

Additionally, the average biking speed was assumed to be ...
### Time of day / seasonality 
Our method of analysis is limited by the time of day. Perceived safety is variable depending on a number of factors, including light levels (Boyce et. al, 2000). Additionally, our method does not include any information on when snow is cleared on certain routes, which would impact the accessibility of biking to certain neighbourhoods during Canadian winters (Sears et. al, 2012.
### Next steps for future study 
Another analysis outside the scope of our project that could be undertaken is a biking justice analysis. Based on many socioeconomic factors from the Canadian census, this would show which neighbourhoods throughout the City of Toronto have access to safe and accessible biking and which neighbourhoods do not. Our team hopes that everyone in the City of Toronto has safe and equitable access to active transportation. However, this analysis was outside of our abilities given the tight timelines of the app challenge.
